      At NanoTrasen, we pride ourselves on cutting-edge military and industrial technology, and greatly appreciate your contribution to our establishment!
      Guardians are helpful and intelligent beings which nest within your body, completely immune to common hazards such as pressure, temperature and even bullets!
      You have purchased the holoparasite package, which contains a holoparasite activator, an instruction booklet, and our softcap merchandise.
      Instructions for use:
      1. Activate the holoparasite injector (preferably in a secluded area).
      2. Wait for the tingling and/or painful metaphysical sensation.
      3. Check your holoparasite for the ability to communicate and cooperate, and capacity to understand your orders.
      4. Use your recall-manifest ability to summon or recall the holoparasite back into your body.
      5. Keep the holoparasite within a short distance from yourself, otherwise it will be recalled by force!
      WARNING: Guardians are metaphysical beings, but draw from your HEALTH in order to exist. Direct damage done to guardians will be partially transferred to you!
      Cybersun inc. is not responsible for complete annihilation following the misuse of Holoparasite technology.
