  # MKC
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobIPCDummy" Caption="MKC"/>
  An MKC (short for Markov Knowledge Chassis) is a type of sapient robot and is considered an [color=yellow]independent individual[/color], meaning [color=red]they are not guided by any laws of robotics[/color]. MKCs cannot be hacked by emags and are not affected by ion storms because they do not have to follow any predefined directives in their system.

  MKCs are silicon-based beings, and thus do not have a bloodstream, cannot ingest any food or drink, do not need to breathe, and [color=red]cannot be healed by normal means at the Medbay.[/color] Damaged MKCs are recommended to be taken to the [color=yellow]Robotics Lab[/color] for repairs, or possibly to [color=yellow]Engineering[/color] depending on crew availability.

  Like borgs, MKCs have a positronic brain as their processing source. However, unlike them, MKCs can't be assembled.
  ## Recharging an MKC
   <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic" Caption="APC Terminal"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PowerCellMedium" Caption="Power Cell"/>
  </Box>
  Instead of food or drink, MKCs have an internal power cell that they must keep charged. This power cell constantly drains at a rate proportionate to the amount of moving around the MKC is doing.

  The internal battery of an MKC can be recharged in two different ways:

  APC Terminal: An MKC can press [color=yellow]Alt + left click[/color] on a powered APC terminal to recharge themselves.

  Power Cell Replacement: Pressing [color=yellow]Alt + left click[/color] or using the right-click menu on an MKC will unlock (or lock) their maintenance panel, allowing their power cell to be taken out and replaced. [color=red]Note that MKCs cannot remove their own power cells![/color]

  ## Integrated Radio

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="EncryptionKeyScience" Caption="Encryption key"/>
  </Box>

  MKCs do [bold]not[/bold] use external radios because they already have one built in. They only need to get an encryption key from a radio. By clicking on an MKC with a [color=yellow]wire cutter[/color], you can remove their keys.
  You can find new keys around the station or remove one from a sector radio using a [color=yellow]screwdriver[/color].

  ## Repairing
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WelderIndustrialAdvanced" Caption="Welder"/>
    Welders can be used to repair [color=yellow]Brute[/color] damage and stop [color=orange]Bleeding[/color]. Be sure to cover your eyes!
  </Box>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CableApcStack" Caption="Cables (any type)"/>
    Cables can be used to repair [color=yellow]Burns[/color], except for caustic.
  </Box>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetSteel" Caption="Steel Sheets"/>
    Steel can be used to repair [color=yellow]Caustic[/color] damage.
  </Box>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetGlass" Caption="Glass Sheets (any type)"/>
    Glass Sheets can be used to repair [color=yellow]Blindness[/color].
  </Box>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetPlasma" Caption="Plasma Sheets"/>
    Plasma Sheets can be used to repair [color=green]Radiation[/color] damage.
  </Box>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetPlastic" Caption="Plastic Sheets"/>
    Plastic Sheets can be used to stop [color=orange]Bleeding[/color].
  </Box>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Lighter" Caption="Lighter"/>
    In a pinch, cauterization via heat damage (such as from attacks by lit welders or lighters) will also heal [color=orange]Bleeding[/color].
  </Box>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Oilpack" Caption="Oil Packs"/>
    MKCs have no blood, but instead have [color=orange]Oil[/color]. Oil packs, which replenish their oil levels, can be ordered by Logistics or printed by Robotics.
  </Box>
  In the event that an MKC dies, after being fully repaired, they should be restarted using the [color=yellow]"Restart"[/color] button (located by right-clicking).

  [color=red]NEVER ELECTROCUTE AN MKC with a defibrillator or in any other way while they're dead, as this will cause the battery to discharge energy rays outward![/color]
