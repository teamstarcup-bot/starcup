#The explosive values for these are pretty god damn mediocre, but SS14's explosion system is hard to understand - this is a good enough approximation of how it was in SS13.
#Ideally, there should be a weak radius around the bomb outside of its gibbing / spacing range capable of dealing fair damage to players / structures.
